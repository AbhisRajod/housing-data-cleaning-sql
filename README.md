# Housing Data Cleaning (SQL Server)

## Overview
Cleaned and normalized a raw housing dataset using SQL Server.
Focus on data quality, determinism, and analytics readiness.

## Tools
- SQL Server (SSMS)
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, String Functions)

## Key Steps
- Schema inspection
- Date normalization
- Address standardization
- Categorical value cleanup
- Duplicate removal
- Schema cleanup

## Notes
- Inefficient methods are included intentionally to show learning progression.
- Optimized approaches are used for final transformations.

## Outcome
Final table is analysis-ready with clean dates, addresses, and no duplicates.

## Project Context
This was a course-guided project used as a learning framework.
All SQL queries, transformations, and logic were independently written and reasoned by me.

No manual edits were performed on the raw data.
